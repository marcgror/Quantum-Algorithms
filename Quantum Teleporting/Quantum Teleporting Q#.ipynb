    "# Quantum Teleportation\n",
    "Teleportation has always been an interesting feature in Quantum Mechanics. In this notebook I will try to implement a quantum algorithm to transport the state ( magnitudes and relative phases) from one qubit to another.\n",
    "For this example, we will need three qubits and two physicists, Alice and Bob. Alice wants to teleport the state of one qubit (data) to Bob, and she will use an entangled pair of qubits shared with Bob for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice begins by preparing her data qubit, and then she entangles it with her other qubit, which is already entangled with Bob's qubit. By READing both qubits, she destroys them, and she can send the resulted two bits to Bob, who will use them to perform single-qubit operations on his half of the entangled paired of qubits, obtaining finally the original data qubit Alice wanted to send."
