# Quantum Algorithms
In this repo I will be uploading my personal projects in Quantum Computation, mainly in Q# and Cirq.

For an easy management of quantum states, the following notation will be used:
|0>=|000>, |1>=|001>, |2>=|010>, |3>=|011>, |4>=|100>, and so on.
## Q#
The Q# code is stored in .qs files, so all the fun will be contained in them. In the Python's notebooks I will only import the Q# operations and run them to see the processes.

Then, the Q# files are commented with details for all the operations, while the notebooks explain the physics of the examples.
